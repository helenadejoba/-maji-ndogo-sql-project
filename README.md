# 🚀 Maji Ndogo SQL Analysis Project (MySQL Workbench)

## 📘 Project Overview
This SQL project was completed as part of my data analytics training with ExploreAI Academy. The goal was to explore the **Maji Ndogo** water services database and gain insights from over **60,000 records**.

### Project Objectives:
- ✅ Get to know the structure and contents of the dataset
- ✅ Dive into data on water sources
- ✅ Unpack visit records to water sources
- ✅ Assess the quality of various water sources
- ✅ Investigate any pollution-related issues

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **MySQL Workbench** – for writing and executing SQL queries
- **MySQL Database (InnoDB engine)** – used for storing and managing relational data
- Structured Query Language (**SQL**)

## 🧠 SQL Skills Demonstrated
- `SHOW TABLES` – to explore the available tables
- `SELECT`, `SELECT DISTINCT` – to retrieve and filter specific data
- `WHERE`, `AND`, `LIKE` – for detailed filtering
- `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY` – to summarize and sort data
- `LIMIT` – to control the number of results
- `SET` – to update values in records

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Analyzed types and conditions of water sources
- Explored visit frequency and purpose
- Identified trends and possible pollution concerns based on water source quality
- Strengthened SQL foundational skills through practical, real-world data exploration

## 📁 Files Included
- `maji_ndogo_analysis.sql` – All SQL scripts used for this project
- `README.md` – This documentation file

## 📌 What’s Next
Future plans include:
- Learning and applying `JOIN` to analyze relationships between tables
- Exploring subqueries and conditional logic
- Visualizing key findings using tools like Power BI or Tableau
